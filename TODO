Before 0.1.0 (first public release):
*Read the sample data file topo0.asc and output a PostScript file of contours, drawn with arcs.
*Produce a 3D Bézier spline of all vertical and horizontal curves, for display purposes.
*Quickly find the triangle any point is in and return its elevation. ✓
*Compute spirals of arbitrary curvature and clothance. ✓
*Create spiral objects (in 3D, so they also have specified start and end elevations)
 with specified
 *length and start and end curvatures;
 *start and end points and curvatures;
 *start and end points and directions. ✓

For later:
*Find the volume of a surface in a boundary, using a quadtree of Halton generators. The test surface is a hemisphere; its boundary is a circle.
*Output an STL file.
*Approximate a spiral arc by at least two circular arcs.
*Implement cross-sections and interpolate between them.
