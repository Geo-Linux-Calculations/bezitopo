/* A surface is a function from a region of 2-space to a scalar elevation.
 * Types of surface include:
 * * a hemisphere (for testing the volume computation routine)
 * * a TIN with its BÃ©zier triangles
 * * an alignment with its cross-sections
 * * the nth lowest of m surfaces
 * * a difference between surfaces.
