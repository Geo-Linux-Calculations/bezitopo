class triangle
/* A triangle has three corners and seven other control points, arranged as follows:
         a
       0   1
     2   3   4
   b   5   6   c
   The corners are arranged counterclockwise so that the area is always nonnegative
   (it can be zero in pathological cases such as all the points in a line, but then
   the elevation and gradient at a point are impossible to compute). It can compute
   the elevation and gradient at any point, but they are valid only inside the triangle.
   They are computed outside the triangle for finding the extrema or for extrapolating
   the surface outside the convex hull.
   
   There are two ways of computing the elevation and gradient within a triangle:
   1. Interpolate cubically using the ten control points.
   2. Interpolate cubically along a side, and interpolate the sideways slope
   linearly between the two endpoints. Do this for all three sides, then weight
   them by the reciprocal of the distance from the three sides.
   The first method produces slight creases along the sides, The second does not,
   but it is harder to find the extrema, and evaluating it outside the triangle
   can yield infinity.
   
   Point 3 is not stored, but is computed from the other control points.
