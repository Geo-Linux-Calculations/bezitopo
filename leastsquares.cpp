/* In a PuppetBar representing a total station setup, pole[0] is (0.0.0)
 * and the height of instrument, pole[1] is the backsight and is normally
 * (but doesn't have to be) in the yz-plane with y positive, and the rest are
 * sideshots and foresights.
 * 
 * The backsight, for proper adjustment, should be measured, but many total
 * stations do not measure it. If it is not measured, the azimuth of
 * Pole[1].displacement is kept, but the vertical angle and distance are
 * replaced with those of the target, which could be Pole[0] of another PuppetBar.
 * 
 * A PuppetBar representing a total station setup generates its own two error
 * terms, representing its tilt.
 * 
 * If you foresight a point, then occupy it, then backsight (and measure) it,
 * this generates three sets of three error terms: between the point as
 * foresighted and its actual position, between the instrument occupying it
 * and its actual position, and between the point as backsighted and its actual
 * position. The actual position and all three setups are adjusted.
